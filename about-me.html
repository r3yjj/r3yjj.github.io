            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Ray, currently a student, studying in both <b>Ngee Ann Poly (NP)</b> and <b>Institute of Technical Education (ITE)</b>. 
            </p>

            <p>   
                I’ve always dreamed of traveling around the world to explore different cultures and lifestyles. Growing up in Singapore — a small island — the things I’ve experienced here are quite limited. I truly believe there’s so much more out there waiting to be discovered, and I hope that one day, when I’m financially stable, this dream will come true.
            </p>

            <p>   
                During my free time, I enjoy listening to and singing songs — especially V-pop, T-pop, K-pop, C-pop, and English pop. Music helps me feel good both mentally and emotionally. I also love taking time to rest as part of my self-care routine. Resting keeps me stress-free and gives me a chance to recharge without having to think about anything. As an animal lover, I also wish that one day I’ll be able to have a pet — preferably a rabbit — so that I can spend more of my free time caring for and bonding with it.

            <p>   
                I have many interests in life, but one that stands out is my dream of starting my own business someday. Ever since I was young, I’ve aspired to run a business in the skincare and makeup industry because it’s something I’m truly passionate about. Although I haven’t started yet — mainly due to my busy school schedule and lack of capital — I hope that once I’ve completed my studies, I’ll be able to focus on building my business and turning that dream into reality.
            </p>
